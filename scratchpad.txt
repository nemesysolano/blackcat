Based on an analysis of the FOREX transaction reports (`AUDJPY=X`, `EURUSD=X`, etc.), a critical observation emerges regarding how the system handles indicator data for currency pairs compared to stocks.

Analyzing the `position_history` within the FOREX JSON files reveals a specific pattern in the calculated indicators:

* **Static Volume (V):** In almost all FOREX transactions, the volume indicator `V` is constant at **1.0**. In contrast, the `trade_wavelet.py` script and stock-based reports (like `AAOI` or `AAPL`) show dynamic, fractional volume values.
* **Static Hurst Exponent (H):** The `H` value in FOREX reports is frequently pinned to exactly **0.2488120027091331**. This suggests that the wavelet-based indicators are not receiving meaningful varying data for FOREX pairs, likely due to how FOREX "tick volume" or 24-hour liquidity is reported compared to centralized stock exchanges.

### Proposed Modifications for FOREX Improvement

To improve FOREX trading without hampering Stocks/Futures, you can implement the following logic in `trade_wavelet.py`:

1. **Adaptive Indicator Scaling:**
Since FOREX pairs often have much lower volatility () than stocks, the `FLOOR` (0.13) and `CEILING` (0.18) constants defined in `trade_wavelet.py` may be too restrictive for FOREX.
* **Modification:** Introduce a multiplier for `Entry Force` specifically for quotes ending in `=X`. This would allow the system to trigger trades on the smaller relative "force" moves typical of high-liquidity FOREX markets.


2. **Handling Missing/Static Volume:**
Because `V` is consistently `1.0` in the FOREX data, the `volume_time_wavelet_direction` indicator is likely providing zero predictive value or "noise" for FOREX while working perfectly for Stocks.
* **Modification:** Use a conditional check. If `quote_name.endswith('=X')`, the model should ignore volume-based wavelet indicators and rely more heavily on price-time direction and force.


3. **Take Profit / Stop Loss Tightening:**
FOREX trades in the reports show very small price movements (e.g., `EURUSD` entry at 1.1 with a stop at 1.1007).
* **Modification:** Implement a "Pip-aware" calculation for TP/SL. While stocks use a percentage of ATR or price, FOREX should use a fixed multiple of the spread or a tighter volatility-based exit to account for the lack of "gaps" compared to stocks.



By differentiating the logic based on the ticker suffix, you ensure the CNN model can specialize its feature set for the 24/7 nature of FOREX without losing the volume-price correlation benefits essential for Stock/Future trading.
